/**
 * Search an element in an unsorted array using minimum number of
 *  comparisons. Given an array of n distinct integers and an element x. 
 * Search the element x in the array using minimum number of comparisons. 
 * Any sort of comparison will contribute 1 to the count of comparisons. 
 * For example, the condition used to terminate a loop, 
 * will also contribute 1 to the count of comparisons each time 
 * it gets executed. 
 * Expressions like while (n) {nâ€“;} also contribute to the count of 
 * comparisons as value of n is being compared internally so as to 
 * decide whether or not to terminate the loop.

 /**
  * How to reduce number of comparisons?
    The idea is to copy x (element to be searched) to last location 
    so that one last comparison when x is not present in arr[] is saved.

Algorithm:

search(arr, n, x)
    if arr[n-1] == x  // 1 comparison
       return "true"
    backup = arr[n-1]
    arr[n-1] = x

    for i=0, i++ // no termination condition
        if arr[i] == x // execute at most n times
                       // that is at-most n comparisons
            arr[n-1] = backup
            return (i < n-1) // 1 comparison
